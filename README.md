<h1>Heya :wave: Visitor!! âœ¨  </h1>

<p>Well, we all ended up on GitHub, right? It's the place where people finally UNDERSTAND what I mean. So, here's my special request:</p>

> ðŸ¤– Beep Boop Beep... This guy seems to understand JSON. Let's make a request...

```json
{
   "name": "Parth Manaktala",
   "Highest Education Details": {
      "Qualification": "Masters of Science",
      "Stream": "Computer Science",
      "Grade": "Well, Does textbook knowledge really matter? Anyways, it's a solid 4",
      "University": "Purdue University"
   },
   "About Me": "I'm a tech enthusiast, a team player who loves to develop. I take challenges as my lessons, aiming to write code that's as well-formatted as a Shakespearean sonnet, follows best practices like a pro chef's recipe, and is as efficient as a ninja."
}
```

Well I can code...

```java
public List<String> getKnownLanguages(){
   List<String> knownLanguages = new LinkedList<>();

   knownLanguages.add("JavaEE");
   knownLanguages.add("Spring Boot");
   knownLanguages.add("Python");
   knownLanguages.add("C#");
   knownLanguages.add(".Net Coret");
   knownLanguages.add(".Net Framework");

   knownLanguages.add("APIGEE");
   knownLanguages.add("AWS");

   return knownLanguages;
}
```

And I do web development too!

```javascript
const getKnownLanguages = () => {
  const knownLanguages = [];

  knownLanguages.push("React");
  knownLanguages.push("Node.js");
  knownLanguages.push("Express");

  return knownLanguages;
};
```
